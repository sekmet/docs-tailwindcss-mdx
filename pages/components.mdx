<h2 style={{fontSize: "0"}} className="invisible m-0 -mb-6">Overview</h2>

Unlike many other CSS frameworks, **Tailwind doesn't include any component classes like `form-input`, `btn`, `card`, or `navbar`**.

Tailwind is a CSS framework for implementing custom designs, and even a component as simple as a button can look completely different from one site to another, so providing opinionated component styles that you'd end up wanting to override anyways would only make the development experience more frustrating.

Instead, you're encouraged to work [utility-first](/docs/utility-first) and [extract your own components](/docs/extracting-components) when you start to notice common patterns in your UI.

<CodeSample lang="html">
<div className="max-w-sm mx-auto">
  <p className="text-sm mb-2 text-gray-600">Simple form input component</p>
  <input className="bg-white focus:outline-none focus:shadow-outline border border-gray-300 rounded-lg py-2 px-4 block w-full appearance-none leading-normal" type="email" placeholder="jane@example.com"/>
</div>
{`
<input className="bg-white focus:outline-none focus:shadow-outline border border-gray-300 rounded-lg py-2 px-4 block w-full appearance-none leading-normal" type="email" placeholder="jane@example.com"/>
`}
</CodeSample>
